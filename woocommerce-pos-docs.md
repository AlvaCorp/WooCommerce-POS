WooCommerce POS Documentation
=============================

# Introduction

WooCommerce POS provides hooks for third-party developers to extend the functionality of the core plugin. WooCommerce POS is in it's very early stages of development so the code (and this document) are subject to rapid change often without notice. If you wish to develop a plugin using these docs, please contact me via [support@woopos.com.au](support@woopos.com.au) so I can keep you in the loop.

Good luck!

# Hooks

If you are familiar with the use of hooks in WordPress and WooCommerce you should have no problem understanding this document. If you don't know what a hook is you should [read this](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) and get comfortable with hooks before you continue.

## Add a settings tab

An explanation about the hook

``` php
add_action( 'some_hook' );
```
